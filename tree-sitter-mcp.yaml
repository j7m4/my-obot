name: Tree-Sitter MCP
shortDescription: Fast semantic code search and analysis using tree-sitter structural parsing
description: |
  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes code structural data generated by tree-sitter for AI-powered code analysis. Search, trace, and analyze code semantically with sub-100ms performance through structural parsing rather than text scanning.

  ## Features
  - **Semantic Search**: Search for functions, classes, and variables by name across your codebase
  - **Usage Tracing**: Find all usages and references of code elements project-wide
  - **Quality Analysis**: Detect code complexity, unused code, and structural problems
  - **Error Detection**: Find syntax issues with detailed context and actionable feedback
  - **Fast Performance**: Sub-100 millisecond searches via tree-sitter's structural parsing
  - **Multi-Language Support**: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, C/C++, Ruby, C#, PHP, Kotlin, Scala, Elixir
  - **Config Format Support**: JSON, YAML, TOML parsing and analysis

  ## What you'll need to connect

  **Required:**
  - **Project Path**: Absolute path to the codebase you want to analyze

  **System Requirements:**
  - Node.js and npm
  - Platform build tools:
    - **Windows**: Visual Studio Build Tools
    - **macOS**: Xcode Command Line Tools
    - **Linux**: build-essential package

  **Setup:**
  1. Install globally: `npm install -g @nendo/tree-sitter-mcp`
  2. Configure with your project path
  3. Start analyzing code semantically

  ## Examples
  - **Search**: "Find all functions named 'authenticate' in the codebase"
  - **Usage**: "Where is the UserService class being used?"
  - **Analysis**: "Analyze code quality and detect complexity issues"
  - **Errors**: "Check for syntax errors in the project"
